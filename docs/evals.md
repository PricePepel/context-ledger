# Evaluation log

## Cycle 1 — Transcript import and retrieval

Define the expected results before implementation. Run `npm test` against a fresh local SQLite file using synthetic transcripts only.

| Eval | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code import | The browser displays user and assistant text with the original filename and JSONL line numbers. Tool output stays out of the imported conversation. |
| Codex import | A matching result is discoverable across providers. The provider filter narrows it and search matches case-insensitively. |
| Repeat and rejected imports | Importing the same data twice returns the same ID. Malformed JSONL and foreign origins add zero sessions. |
| Browser rendering | Imported text containing HTML is displayed literally. An unmatched query explains that there are no results. |

## Cycle 2 — Portable handoff

| Eval | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| CLI search | The same provider and query yield the same IDs in the CLI and browser. |
| CLI handoff | An exported Markdown packet includes provider, source, role and line for each turn. Retrieval of a missing session exits nonzero. |
| Regression | Cycle 1 passes against a fresh database. |

## Results — 2026-11-06

- Cycle 1 passed the browser import/search journey and the API integrity eval. Backend smoke checks also verified persistence after restart, Host rejection, and the streamed request limit. Review found that Codex synthetic user-role context could leak into the library. The parser now filters known context blocks while preserving neighboring user text. The browser also checks file size before reading and renders rows without a variadic call.
- Cycle 2 passed browser-to-CLI retrieval and handoff export, including missing IDs and literal rendering of transcript Markdown and terminal controls. Claude reviewed the CLI independently. The follow-up review verified the fixes in the backend, browser, and CLI.
- Final Windows Playwright run passed 3 of 3 tests. GitHub Actions runs the same suite on Linux.
- Live handoff smoke passed with Claude Haiku using a synthetic packet. Claude recovered the expected action, source filename, and original line 2 from the CLI output.

## Cycle 3 — Semantic graph handoff

- G1 accepts version 1 packets with typed nodes and valid source lines. It rejects duplicate IDs or edges, dangling references, invalid edge types, and cycles in dependencies or supersession. Pending actions with open blockers or incomplete prerequisites are excluded. A superseded decision is excluded from current decisions.
- G2 publishes a valid packet for one imported session, returns the same ID for an identical retry, and retrieves it after a restart. Invalid provenance and foreign origins are rejected before writing.
- G3 publishes a selected JSON file and reads the stored packet from the local CLI. It emits JSON that a second agent or a program can parse. Existing Markdown output keeps its behavior.
- G4 runs the new capabilities and the existing browser, API, and CLI regressions in Playwright using synthetic data.
- G5 verifies a clean reviewed diff and GitHub Actions on the review branch. G6 identifies the next capability and defines its decision gate.

## Results — Cycle 3, 2026-11-06

- G1–G4 were implemented by Codex on graph/* worktrees and integrated on feature/semantic-graph. Codex hit its usage limit during G5, so Claude Code took over integration (user-approved).
- Windows: Playwright 5 of 5, graph unit tests 9 of 9, graph CLI and restart tests 3 of 3.
- An independent Claude review of 48775b0..6bad64a found no critical or high defects. Two medium findings were fixed:
  - Graph and search JSON passed DEL, C1 controls, bidi/format characters and U+2028/9 to the terminal raw, because `JSON.stringify` only escapes below U+0020. The CLI now escapes them as `\uXXXX`. The output is still lossless JSON. A test that fails on the old CLI covers graph read and search.
  - The G2 "retrieves after a restart" criterion had no test. `tests/graph-restart.test.mjs` now publishes, stops the server, starts a new process on the same SQLite file, and reads the graph back.
- Low findings: derived-state unit tests now pin combined blocker and prerequisite waits, a resolved blocker alone, supersession chains, and shared supersession targets. The README now states that evidence must cite a stored user or assistant line, and that array order affects graph identity.
- The follow-up review verified these fixes and flagged the handoff Markdown path. It escaped only `\p{Cc}`, so bidi overrides (filename spoofing) and invisible tag characters (hidden text) reached readers raw. It now escapes `\p{Cf}` as well, keeping ZWJ and ZWNJ so emoji sequences render, and astral characters are escaped as correct surrogate pairs. `tests/handoff-cli.test.mjs` covers this.

## Core bug scan — 2026-11-06

An independent scan of the server, store, parsers and browser UI found no critical or high bugs. Host and Origin checks, body limits, atomic idempotent import, literal `instr` search, line numbering with BOM/CRLF/blank lines, and `textContent`-only rendering were probed and found sound. Fixed, with `tests/store.test.mjs`:

- Medium: older Codex rollouts without per-block metadata leaked `<user_instructions>` and `<turn_aborted>` envelopes as user turns, which polluted search and could become the session title. These are now filtered as complete envelopes, like `<environment_context>`.
- Low: a title was cut at 120 UTF-16 units, which could split an emoji and store a lone surrogate. It is now cut by code point.

Noted, not changed: Greek final sigma can make a lowercase query miss its match. Re-importing identical content under a new filename keeps the first name (intended idempotency). Claude `isSidechain` and `isCompactSummary` records import as ordinary turns, and this needs a format decision.

Totals after fixes (Windows): graph unit 9 of 9, CLI/restart/handoff/store 6 of 6, Playwright 5 of 5.
